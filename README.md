# 3D Game Engine

## Overview
This 3D Game Engine was written entirely in C++ . In this project, I implemented major features relevant to 3D game engines, such as:

- A* pathfinding
- Bounding Volume Hierarchies (BVH)
- Cylinder Collisions
- Ellipse-Triangle Mesh Collisions
- Third- and First-Person Camera Controls
- Raycasting

## Final Project
For my final project, I created an aim trainer in partnership with a classmate who worked on the UI for the game. 
This made use of camera controls for aiming at targets and raycasting for shooting them, as well as a score system and different gamemodes. 
I also loaded in a custom mesh-based map and customized the sky color to provide an immersive experience. 


## Acknowledgements
This engine was created for 3D Game Engines (CS1950u) at Brown University.
